This repository demonstrates a common error in R when using the `na.omit()` function. The provided `bug.R` script shows how `na.omit()` removes entire rows containing any NA values, which may lead to unintended data loss if you only want to remove NAs from specific columns. The solution `bugSolution.R` illustrates how to achieve selective NA removal using other more robust methods.
